--Five Brave Explorer Story--
Once upon a time, five best friends — Mia, Leo, Zara, Finn, and their clever dog Toby — were exploring Grandpa Joe’s attic when they found a dusty, rolled-up map.
It had wiggly lines, tiny drawings of trees and rocks, and a big red “X” marked on a little island labeled: "Treasure Here!"

“Let’s go find it!” shouted Leo, who always dreamed of being a pirate.
They packed their bags with juice boxes, peanut butter sandwiches, walkie-talkies, and Toby’s squeaky duck.
Then they set sail on Leo’s boat, The Sea Snail, with white sails and a wooden deck that creaked just a little.

The sea sparkled in the sunlight, and dolphins leapt beside the boat as Toby barked happily.
After a few hours, they spotted an island with tall palm trees, white sand, and a rainbow-colored parrot squawking from the treetops.

“X marks the spot, let’s go!” cheered Zara.

Using the map, they tiptoed past a tree shaped like a dragon, over a wobbly rope bridge, and around a bubbling mud pond.
Near a twisted oak tree, Toby started digging with his paws, barking like crazy.

Thunk! His paws hit something hard.
Everyone helped dig, and together they pulled out an old wooden chest with golden edges.
When Mia opened it, they all gasped — the chest was full of sparkling jewels, gold coins, and a crown with shiny blue diamonds.

But before they could celebrate, a gruff voice growled, “That treasure belongs to us!”

Three mean-looking strangers stepped out from behind the bushes.
They wore long black coats, sunglasses, and carried big nets.

“Run!” shouted Finn, grabbing the map.

The friends dashed into the jungle, dodging branches and hopping over roots.
Zara tossed a coconut at one of the men — bonk! — and he fell flat on his back.
Toby bit a hole in one of the nets, then barked and led the way back to the beach.

They all jumped onto The Sea Snail, and Leo hoisted the sail as the wind picked up.
The bad guys shouted from the shore, but the boat was already gliding away.

“Nice throw with the coconut,” said Finn, grinning.
“And good bite, Toby!” added Mia, giving him a treat.

Back home, they told Grandpa Joe everything.
He laughed and said, “That old map? I found it in a bottle when I was your age!”

They decided to hide the treasure in their secret treehouse — only Toby knew exactly where.
Later that night, under the stars, the five friends made a promise:
“Wherever the next map takes us, we go together.”

And far away, in Grandpa Joe’s attic, an old book shifted slightly… as if something inside was waiting to be found.
